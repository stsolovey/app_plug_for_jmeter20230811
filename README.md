## File Setup for Load Testing

To use this application with JMeter for load testing, you'll need to add specific files to the `files/download` directory. The files you add will depend on the desired load you want to test. Here are the recommended files:

- `5MB.zip`: For light load testing.
- `10MB.zip`: For moderate load.
- `20MB.zip`: Provides a heavier load.
- `100MB.zip`: For more intensive load testing scenarios.
- `200MB.zip`: Use with caution, as it will significantly increase the load.
- `512MB.zip`: For very high load testing scenarios.
- `1GB.zip`: Only recommended for stress testing to the maximum capacity.

Choose and add the appropriate files based on your testing requirements.
